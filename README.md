Meetpy website - this is a shared website along polish Python meetup groups.

## Local install and setup

You can run `provision-new-dev-envirionment.sh` on your dev environment â€“ it will create
everything necessary (using virutalenv) for basic development.

Alternatively you can use Docker and Docker Compose:
`docker-compose up` it will setup a container with meetpy Django app
(available at http://localhost:8080), a Postgres database with a PhpPgAdmin
interface (available at http://localhost:8082) and a mock of SMTP service
(available at http://localhost:8081).

For more info read the script, or ask us on slack.
